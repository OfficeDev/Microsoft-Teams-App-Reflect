# Microsoft Reflect messaging extension for Teams overview

### UPDATE: ###
Due to the strong interest  in the Reflect project, we are excited to announce that the Reflect feature is being incorporated into upcoming updates to both the Workplace Analytics solution for our commercial customers and into the Class Insights solution offered to our education customers. As part of these fully-hosted, production-level solutions Reflect will be easier than ever to enable for your organization and easier for your tenant users to access the feature in Teams. They will also offer many of the feature requests made here by the community, including requests for localization and additional reporting features. 

**With the introduction of these production-level offerings that include the Reflect capability, we are archiving this open source project and invite anyone interested in the Reflect functionality to check out either (or both) of these solutions. Thank you for your interest and contributions to this project.**

The update to the Class Insights solution is coming in Spring 2021.

We thrive when we are working and learning in environments that support our emotional wellbeing. These are environments in which we feel heard, valued, safe, and included.

Group leaders (e.g., meeting leaders, managers, teachers) struggle to collect information about the emotional state of each of their group members, yet this information is helpful for understanding how to support their groups’ engagement, productivity, collaboration, wellbeing, and intra-group relationships.

The Reflect messaging extension helps team members be more aware of their own, and each other’s, emotional state during communication by giving them the ability to create simple, effective, and engaging emotional check-ins directly in the flow of a conversation in Teams. 

Group leaders can check-in with their team members about how they are feeling in general, or about a specific topic, such as an assignment, the experience of learning or working from home, or current events in their community.
